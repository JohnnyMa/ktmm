# ktmm (Keep That Mouse Moving)


## What is this?
Ever needed to stop your computer from going into Idle mode?

Now it's super simple!

## How does it work?
This little guy will move your mouse back and forth a tiny little bit every second; and you won't even notice it!

## When would I ever use this?
Works well in companies where you can't stop your computer from Idling and things start showing as you're away when you've decided to go relax on the beach!


## 1. Get Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/ao/ktmm.git
cd ktmm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Just run it
`python ktmm.py`


## If you want to run it in a virtualenv then do this instead:

```
git clone https://github.com/ao/ktmm.git
cd ktmm
pip install -r requirements.txt
virtualenv -p python3 env
env/bin/python python ktmm.py
```
